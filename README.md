# Face Detection

## Introduction

This mini-project was done using the incredible package, that is OpenCV packages. I've followed the instruction on [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-b738bb0f7348) website, he explain the workflow and "how to do" in each work-phase in a comprehensive way, I recommend that you take the time to look at the primary source. Only in this case, I was used my face to be detected. The workflow is represented by the following figure

The result is displayed in the following figure
